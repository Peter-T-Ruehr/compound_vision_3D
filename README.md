# compound_vision_3D
This repository contains
* R pacckage to automatically extract 3D information (number of facets, facet positions, inter-facet angles, sensitivity and acuity) of compound eyes.

## Additional unpublished but existing code:
### (This is part of an analysis manuscript - it is not yet decided which code will be part of the package)
* `ImageJ macro language`
    * crop out the left and the right eye from a CT image stacks of various sources
    * crop out head capsule and automatically scale down for landmarking if necessary
    * automatically generate surface STLs of compund eyes
* `Python`
  * extract compund eye surface from STLs in Blender
* `R`
  * import compund eye STL to R
  * extract 
  * analyse the local topological differences of facet sizes and inter-facet angles
  * calculate field of view (FOV) on local differences of acuity and sensitivity within FOV
  * compare these values in an phylogenetic comparative framework
  * analyse the trade-off between acuity and sensitivity across species

This is an alpha-version and still under development.
